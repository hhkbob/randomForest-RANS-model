This is an example for our paper "A random forest machine learning in turbulence closure modeling for complex flows and heat transfer based on the non-equilibrium turbulence assumption"

[1] First, download the training data from google drive and put these data into the dataRANS folder. The save link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/174UHlnLEjkaPs7ElPy_h6lumgCCTHBng?usp=sharing

[2] Secondly, run the Python file "randomForest.py". 
    if no error, you may get the following information: 
    ![rf](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/574075f6-46e4-4dcc-a32a-c66f3a6094b3)
    
[3] Compute the relative error. Run the Python file "testError.py". The output error file is "errors.txt"

[4] Plot the RMS error and the relative error. Run the Python file "errorPlot.py"
    RMS error (an example 'RFError.pdf')
    ![RFErrors](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/03adc12c-d8dd-4f96-ba12-400e0540310a)
    Relative error (an example 'densitys.pdf')
    ![densitys](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4d87e1c1-162b-46f5-bb33-171125a755d4)
